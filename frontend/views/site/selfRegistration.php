                <h2>Guest self registration</h2>

                <p>In acording with the Law (here we need link on law text) every guest must be registered in
                    <a class="btn btn-default" href="https://www.evisitor.hr">eVisitor</a> information system. It is simple, but needs some time and filling boring forms...With selfin you can do it faster and easier.
                Just let your guest install Selfin on their smartphone and scan their IDs or passport. Application also ask then to make selfie to be 100% sure that it was done by them. Oue face recognition technology will automatically
                    compare selfies with photo from IDs or passport and fill all nessesary forms instead of people. If you want to change something - application will provide you and your guests such functionality.</p>

                <p> Have a free time for doing something more pleasure instead of boring forms filling.</p>
